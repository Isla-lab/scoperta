# 🧭 SCOPERTA: Mobile Robot Simulation with CoppeliaSim and ROS 2

This repository provides a **CoppeliaSim–ROS 2 integration workspace** for mobile robot simulation and control.  
It includes both **low-level perception and control nodes** (e.g. LIDAR-based navigation) and **high-level logic** (e.g. finite state machine coordination).
